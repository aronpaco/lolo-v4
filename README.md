## Guide:
* In the search box, write a url of an RSS feed. For example, https://time.com/feed
* If it fails, try including **https://** before the address and **/feed** or **.rss** in the end!
* After loading the first one, you can enter another! The articles will be sorted by date, so you might have to scroll down to see the others.
